//1. What is Docker?

Docker is a tool that helps you run apps inside containers.

A container is like a small, packed box that includes:

  * Your app

  * The software it needs (Node, Python, etc.)

  * OS-level tools

This makes sure the app works anywhere, even if other people use different computers.

Example: You made an app on your laptop. If you send the Docker container to your friend, it will work exactly the same on their PC too — without errors like “this package is missing.

//2. What is a Dockerfile?
A Dockerfile is a plain text file that has instructions to build your app's container.

It tells Docker:
Which base system to use (like Node, Python, etc.)

Where to put your app files

How to install the required packages

How to start the app

Example:

FROM node:18          # Base image
WORKDIR /app          # Working folder
COPY . .              # Copy app files
RUN npm install       # Install packages
CMD ["npm", "start"]  # Start the app

// 3. What is Docker Compose?
Sometimes your project needs multiple containers —
for example:

One container for the backend app

One for the database (MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)

Instead of running them separately, Docker Compose allows you to define everything 
in one file called docker-compose.yml.

example:

version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  db:
    image: mongo
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
