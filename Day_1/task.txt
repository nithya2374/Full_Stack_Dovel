1. what is description list?
    
    A description list in HTML is used to represent terms and their descriptions, like in glossaries,FAQS or resumes.
    Elements of a Description List:
      <dl>- the description list container.
      <dt>- a term
      <dd>-the description or definition of that term.

    Example:
       <dl>
         <dt><strong>Unit Director</strong></dt>
         <dd>Rover games,April 2019-Present</dd>

         <dt><strong>Internal Project Manager</strong></dt>
         <dd>Tesla,April 2012-March 2014</dd>
       </dl>

2. Another semantic tag for delete tag

      there is no another semantic tag for delete but have,

      <s>- strikethrough(stylistic, not semantic) for text thats no longer accurate or relevant.
      Example:
        <p><s>$100</s> $75 </p>
        output:
          * $100 is shown with a strikethrough(crossed out)
          * $75 is shown normally,inidicating the new or discounted price.


      <ins>- semantic tag for inserted text (shows underline) and to inidicate newly added text.
      Example:
        <p><ins>New feature added</ins></p>
        output:
            New feature added(with an underline)
            * underline shows an newly inserted or added.
            * semantic opposite of <del>
