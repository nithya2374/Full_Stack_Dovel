## Difference Between a Library and a Framework

## Library

- A library is a collection of pre-written code that provides specific functionality.
- It offers tools or functions that you can call in your own code whenever needed.
- Control remains with the developer — you call the library.

Example:jQuery, Lodash, React (React is often considered a library because it focuses only on the UI).

## Framework

- A framework is a pre-defined structure that provides a foundation to build applications.
- It dictates the architecture and flow — the framework calls your code.
- Developers plug their code into the framework's lifecycle.

Example: Angular, Django, Spring

## Key Difference

- Control Inversion: In libraries, the developer is in charge. In frameworks, the framework is in charge of the flow.
