In JavaScript, arrow functions do not have their own this. Instead, they lexically inherit this from the enclosing scopeâ€”that is, from the context in which they were defined.

So, yes, you can use this inside an arrow function, but it behaves differently from regular functions.

Key Differences:

   * Regular function: this is determined by how the function is called.

   * Arrow function: this is determined by where the function is defined (lexical scoping).

Example:
  const obj = 
  {
    name: "Nathiya",
    greet: function () 
    {
       setTimeout(() => {
          console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
       }, 1000);
    }
  };

obj.greet(); 

Output: Hello, Nathiya

In this example, the arrow function inside setTimeout inherits this from the greet method, 
which is bound to obj.
